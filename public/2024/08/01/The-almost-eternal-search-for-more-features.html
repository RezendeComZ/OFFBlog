<p>In a recent post, I wrote about stopping the development of new features for this blog and focusing on other projects. However, itâ€™s not so easy to stick to that plan. The blog itself is a project, and while text is a powerful way to communicate, images and links are very helpful too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, I intended to write an article about something else, but in the first paragraph, I realized that an image would be perfect to illustrate an idea. I thought, "Okay, just an HTML tag will do the work." But then I wondered how to host the image. The blog system cannot handle that yet. What about centering the image and giving credits? I could do this with pure HTML, but it might result in inconsistent image layouts, making each post look different.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, I'm back to working on the blog again, hehe.</p>
