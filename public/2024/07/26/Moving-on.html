<p>When I start a new project, it's hard to determine when to stop. I always begin with the intention of learning something new, but often fall into the trap of improving the project, polishing, and doing things within my "comfort zone" (I dislike this term) by focusing on tasks I already know how to do. This leads to me being stuck in the project until I lose the motivation to continue.</p>
<p>For this blog, I had a long roadmap with many tasks, like FTP support, a newsletter, RSS, and more. I often wonder if I'm using my time to do something meaningful or if I'm just wasting it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I intent to keep in Python language and study I.A in depth while applying in a new project. As I do this, I hope to document the process here, keeping the blog active without making a lot of changes to the blog system itself.</p>
