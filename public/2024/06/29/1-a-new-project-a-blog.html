Before Clojure, my first language was JavaScript. Although I know how to do some DOM manipulation and understand the syntax, I am not a big fan, so I searched for another language. Java appeared to be right for me, although it is very verbose. Even so I tried it, and it was a really slow process, and I didn't feel that I was doing something meaningful (actually, it does not need to be meaningful, just be something that runs :D), I was just learning about syntax, package managers, how to run, etc. My project wasnâ€™t going anywhere.</p><p></p><p>So I'm trying to learn Python. Once the language was chosen, I needed a project, so I decided to write a simple static blog generator. Yeah, just HTML, no comments, no interaction, no login, just like 1994 :).</p><p></p><p>If you are reading this on an HTML page, it worked!</p></article></body></html>
