# Dealing with errors

The builder now handles situations where the 'public' directory is unwritable with simple error detection.
Logging has been added to verify whether operations succeed or fail.
By default, the '.gitignore' file does not ignore the 'public' directory.
Additionally, posts now include a date at the end and have a proper title.
