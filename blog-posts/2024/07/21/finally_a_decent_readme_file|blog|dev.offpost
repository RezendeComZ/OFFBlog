# Finally a decent README file

Okay, the README.md could be better, I admit. But some things are working, including the index file. In the coming weeks I will focus on another project and will use this blog as a diary. For now, the blog itself is the project.

I intend to support more Markdown features, like <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> (I'm using HTML here), and other necessary elements. This blog system doesn't aim to have high level features, quite the opposite. I wouldn't have time for that anyway :).

To prove a point, an HTML tag with a YouTube video:
