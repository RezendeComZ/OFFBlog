# A New Project, a blog.

Since I'm a Clojure developer, it is a niche language, so I want to be closer to a mainstream programming language. Before Clojure, my first language was JavaScript. Although I know how to do some DOM manipulation and syntax, I am not a big fan, so I searched for another language. Java appeared to be right for me, although it is very verbose. Even so I tried, and it was a really slow process, and I didn't feel that I was doing something meaningful (actually, it does not need to be meaningful, just be something that runs :D), I was just learning about syntax, package managers, how to run, etc. My project wasnâ€™t going anywhere.

So I'm trying to learn Python. Once the language was chosen, I needed a project, so I decided to write a simple static blog generator, yeah, just HTML, no comments, no interaction, no login, just like 1994 :).

If you are reading this in an HTML page, it worked!
